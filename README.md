# üèπ Play Archery - A Responsive HTML5 Canvas Game


A fun, lightweight archery game built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The goal is simple: hit the moving target to score as many points as you can before you run out of arrows.

This project is fully responsive and designed to work seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones, supporting both mouse and touch controls.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Fully Responsive:** Uses modern CSS (`aspect-ratio`, media queries) to adapt to any screen size.
* **HTML5 Canvas Rendering:** All dynamic game elements (bow, arrow, target) are rendered on an HTML5 canvas.
* **Simple Physics:** The arrow is affected by gravity, making shots more challenging and rewarding.
* **Power Mechanic:** Press and hold to charge up your shot for more power and distance.
* **Scoring System:** Different points are awarded for hitting different rings of the target.
* **Moving Target:** The target moves up and down to increase the difficulty.
* **Game State Management:** Includes a start menu, pause/resume functionality, and a game-over screen.
* **Audio Controls:** Background music with a mute/unmute toggle.
* **Cross-Device Controls:** Works with both mouse (desktop) and touch (mobile/tablet) events.
* **Zero Dependencies:** Written in pure, vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks or libraries needed.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

1.  **Aim:** Move your mouse cursor or drag your finger across the screen to aim the bow.
2.  **Charge Shot:** Press and hold the left mouse button or keep your finger held down on the screen. The power bar at the bottom will fill up.
3.  **Shoot:** Release the mouse button or lift your finger to fire the arrow.
4.  **Objective:** Score points by hitting the target. The closer to the center, the more points you get! Try to get the highest score with your 10 arrows.
